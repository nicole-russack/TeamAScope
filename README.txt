# Scopr Hackathon
Scope Hackathon 2021 Submission

## Inspiration
Scope is a popular Computer Science student organization at USC. Every week there are new lunch buddies, one person from the organization you should try to have lunch with. There is also a Scope Cup, where the organization is broken up into teams and each team can score points via attendance and collaboration. We wanted to create an application to track these points and to show the lunch buddies for the week.

## What it does
In this application the user can add points to a team by entering the amount and then chooseing the team in the dropdown menu. They can also shuffle lunch buddies for the week by clicking the shuffle button. 

## How we built it
We first made a low-fidelity model using Figma and continued to develop the idea going from our design. After finalizing the features we wanted to include we created the front end to the web application using HTML and CSS. We stored the data in Firebase and integrated it to our front end using JavaScript. We then deployed the application by using Heroku.
